/// A **rectangular maze** using a **graph structure** to represent connections between cells, called vertices.
///
/// This graph is undirected and non weighted.
///
/// ## Vertices
///
/// Each **vertex** corresponds to a **cell of the maze**, identified by an integer in `[0, width*height[`.
///
/// A 2D point can be converted to a vertex using [#toVertexId(Point)], using the `x+height*y` formula.
///
/// For example, in a 4x4 maze:
/// ```
/// 0  1  2  3
/// 4  5  6  7
/// 8  9  10 11
/// 12 13 14 15
///```
///
/// ## Edges
///
/// Each **edge** corresponds to a **missing wall** between two cells that are next to each other.
///
/// Cells that are too far apart (diagonals, distance â‰¥ 2) cannot be connected at all. We'll assume
/// that vertices A and B are always next to each other in the maze.
///
/// When an edge exists between A and B, there's no wall between A and B: you can walk from A to B.
///
/// When an edge doesn't exist between A and B, there's a wall between A and B: you cannot walk from A to B.
///
/// ## Endpoints
///
/// The maze can have a **start** and an **end** vertex. They can be either:
/// - not defined, both equal to -1
/// - defined, both different and valid vertices.
///
/// The existence of a path between the start and end vertices is not guaranteed.
///
/// ## Querying the maze
///
/// - [#isConnected(int, int)]: Tells if two vertices are connected.
/// - [#getAdjacentVertices(int)]: Get all atteignable vertices based on a start vertex.
///
/// You can also iterate through all vertices of this graph with a simple `for` loop:
///
/// ```java
/// GraphMaze gm;
/// for (int i = 0; i < gm.getNumCells(); i++){
///     // ... Do stuff with i ...
///}
///```
///
/// ## Changing the maze
///
/// - [#connect(int, int)]: Add an edge between two vertices.
/// - [#disconnect(int, int)]: Remove an edge between two vertices.
/// - [#setConnected(int, int, boolean)]: Add/remove an edge between two vertices.
/// - [#setEndpoints(int, int)]: Set the start and end points of the maze
